			Warcraft 3 is an Real Time Strategy game that today comes in 2 flavors(Reign Of Chaos and The Frozen
			Throne).
			Released for the 1st time back in July 2002, the first version of Warcraft 3 was the "Reign Of Chaos" pack.
			Exactly 1 year later on 1st July 2003 was released the today infamous and alot more well known new package
			of
			Warcraft 3 "The Frozen Throne".
			The developers and owners of Warcraft III are
			<a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Blizzard Entertainment</a>
			who are more famous for their other more popular games such as: World Of Warcraft, Starcraft II, the Diablo
			franchise,
			Hearth Stone and Overwatch, to name a few, as well as many more projects they've worked on alone or in
			partnership with
			other bigger game development companies.

			Over the years, Warcraft 3 has gained an incredible fanbase, and alot of fanmade "mods" or "modes" have been
			created
			causing an evolution of the game and changing the course of Warcraft 3. Initially, the 1st Warcraft 3 Reign
			Of Chaos mods were the now(and probabbly then) known classical mods, which were the 1st maps made by
			Blizzard themselves
			and packet into the Reign Of Chaos package. They were the "classic" strategy mods, where players had a
			choice of 4 races/classes:
			human, night elf, orc and undead.

			With the release of The Frozen Throne, new maps were added to Warcraft.
			The new version of Warcraft III included both RoC and TFT game flavors, and an additional specific for the
			game map
			creation tool was added, the players were now able to create custom maps, add them to the game and play
			them.
			There are a lot of fan made maps and mods available on the internet, most(if not all) of the websites from
			where you
			can download them are made by the Warcraft community and player/fanbase. Here are 2 of the most popular
			sites to download
			custom Warcraft III maps:

			Each race has it's strengths and weaknesses, depending on the matchup, a race is "better"
			against 1 race and weak against another. <br>
			Each race is composed of different types of units and buildings with various different designs.
			The aim in the classical mod is to destroy all the enemy's buildings(though in some mods you have
			to destroy all enemy buildings as well as all of their units).<br>
			The players can build an army of up to 100 "food", though different units take less or more food.
			For example, the "worker" units take 1 food each, however, units such as knights(human units) take
			4 food, fiends(undead) take 3, grunts(orc) take 3, archers(night elf) 2.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>
			There are a lot of units in the game, but the most important ones are the hero units.
			There is a total of 16 heroes available(depending on the class you play, 4 of them are from that class).
			These are the "classic" heroes, but TFT also includes special "tavern heroes", which you can get form the
			"tavern".
			The players can have up to 3 heroes in their army.
			The classic heroes can only be used by players who play the race of those heroes, for example:<br>
			humans: Archmage, Mountain King, Paladin, Blood Mage<br>
			night elf heroes: Keeper Of The Groove, Demon Hunter, Priestess Of The Moon, Warden<br>
			orc: Far Seer, Blade Master, Tauren Chieftain, Shadow Hunter<br>
			undead: Death Knight, Lich, Dread Lord, Creep Lord<br>
		</p>

		<p>
			Tavern Heroes on the other hand can be used no matter what race the player is playing.

			With so many classic + Tavern heroes, we are going to cover just the classic heroes for each race briefly:
			The rest you can read about on the more extensive and indepth warcraft 3 community and fanmade websites,
			<a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos" target="_blank">wowpedia</a> being
			one of the
			best places for that, along side the numerous other units each race offers a	s well as their buildings and
			even items and all other
